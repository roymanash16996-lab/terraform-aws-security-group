## Version 0.0.4 (2025-09-14)
### Previous Logic
- Resource selection in `locals.tf` previously relied on multiple flags (`use_name_prefix`, `create_before_destroy`, and user input), referencing several resource variants and leading to complex, ambiguous logic for choosing the correct security group resource and outputs.
- Deprecated resource variants (e.g., `this-name-prefix-dbc`, `this-name-prefix-cbd`) were present in locals and comments, increasing confusion and maintenance overhead.
- Comments and documentation were inconsistent across files, making onboarding and troubleshooting more difficult.
- Data source creation logic in `network.conf.tf` was less explicit, with limited validation and error handling for VPC selection.
- Output logic in `outputs.tf` did not consistently use null-safe patterns, risking errors when referencing outputs for external security groups.

### New Logic (v0.0.4)
- `locals.tf` logic is now fully centralized and simplified:
  - Resource selection depends only on `create_before_destroy` and user input (`security_group_id`), removing all legacy resource variants and flags.
  - The correct security group ID and object are selected using clear coalesce logic, ensuring rules and outputs always reference the intended resource.
  - Comments are expanded to explain the rationale, conditional logic, and use cases for each local value, supporting maintainability and onboarding.
- `main.tf` and `network.conf.tf` updated for clarity and reliability:
  - Resource creation logic now matches the simplified locals, with explicit conditions for each resource and data source.
  - Data source creation for VPC and region selection uses clear variable dependencies and count logic, with improved error handling and validation (e.g., aborting if multiple VPCs match a name).
  - All comments now follow a unified documentation standard, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
- `outputs.tf` logic improved:
  - Outputs consistently reference locals, using `try` for null safety to avoid errors when using external security groups.
  - Output documentation clarifies when values are null and how to use them downstream.

### Rationale and Advantages
- **Simplicity & Maintainability:**
  - Centralized logic in `locals.tf` reduces duplication and ambiguity, making future updates and troubleshooting easier.
  - Removal of deprecated resource variants and legacy flags streamlines the codebase and documentation.
- **Reliability & Predictability:**
  - Explicit resource selection and output logic ensure that only the intended resources are created and referenced, reducing risk of drift and errors.
  - Improved validation and error handling in data source creation prevent ambiguous VPC selection and guide users to correct configuration.
- **Onboarding & Collaboration:**
  - Unified comments and documentation across all Terraform files make it easier for new users and collaborators to understand the module's logic and usage.
  - Clear rationale and use case explanations support best practices and compliance.
- **Extensibility:**
  - The simplified logic and documentation provide a strong foundation for future enhancements, such as supporting additional resource types or advanced conditional logic.
- **Null Safety & Integration:**
  - Consistent use of null-safe patterns in outputs ensures robust integration with other modules and prevents runtime errors.

### Fixed
- Patch context errors and reliability issues addressed in codebase (excluding README.md)
- Improved code comments and documentation in all Terraform files for clarity and maintainability

### Notes
- This release supersedes v0.0.3 and reflects all recent logic, maintainability, and documentation improvements in the Terraform codebase
- Please update the commit hash in the example usage to reference the correct version
